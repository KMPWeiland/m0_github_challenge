# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
*After a  new directory and file have been created on your local device, make sure to initialize that directory using `init commit`. Then add the file name and commit your changes (this will be your "Initial commit"). Then go to GitHub and create a new repository (NB: make sure you select SSH before you finish the next step). Finally, copy the code provided by GitHub to your teminal. Refresh your GitHub page et voil√†!
